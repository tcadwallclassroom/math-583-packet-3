## Tidying Data

So far, we've been using the `openintro` data sets, which are great in may ways because they have already been *tidied*. That is, the data has been collected into a frame in such a way that it is easy for us to use.

Many data sets take some work to tidy up. There may be variables we want to ignore, missing values we need to deal with, and so on. 

For this exercise, read [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20160223192726/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/opinion/sunday/let-math-save-our-democracy.html). As an activity, I'd like to  recreate the mean-median difference for the 2012 Pennsylvania House election.
